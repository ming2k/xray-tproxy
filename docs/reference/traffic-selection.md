# Traffic Selection Reference

Lookup for what the nftables rules in
[xray-tproxy.nft](../../xray-tproxy.nft) intercept and what they bypass.
The tables are `ip xray_v4` and `ip6 xray_v6`; each has a `prerouting`
chain (traffic passing through) and an `output` chain (locally generated
traffic).

## Constants

| Name | Value | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| `XRAY_MARK` | `1` | fwmark on intercepted packets; policy routing sends it to table `110` |
| `BYPASS_MARK` | `2` | fwmark that skips interception; Xray outbounds set it via `sockopt.mark` |
| `XRAY_TPROXY_PORT` | `12345` | Xray `dokodemo-door` inbound port |
| routing table | `110` | Contains `local default dev lo` for mark-1 packets |
| policy rule priority | `32765` | Set by the `systemd-networkd` drop-in |

## Intercepted and Bypassed Rule Order

Rules evaluate top to bottom in both `prerouting` and `output` chains; first match applies:

1. **Mark-2 bypass** (`meta mark $BYPASS_MARK return`): Xray's own outbound connections must not loop.
2. **ICMP bypass** (`ip protocol icmp return`, `icmpv6 type { ... } return`): Ping and neighbor discovery stay direct.
3. **DNS loop exemption** (`meta skuid "xray"/"systemd-resolve" dport 53 ... meta mark 0 return` in `output`; `ip daddr 127.0.0.53 dport 53 meta mark 0 return` in IPv4 `prerouting`): Xray's `localhost` queries and resolved's upstream forwards leave unmarked and reach their real destinations. Without this pair the localhost DNS path re-intercepts itself and starves.
4. **DNS interception** (`tcp/udp dport 53` -> TProxy / mark 1): Intercepted **before** IP range bypass so DNS queries to LAN gateways (e.g. `192.168.1.1:53`) do not bypass Xray and leak plaintext queries to GFW.
5. **Reserved & LAN IP bypass** (`ip daddr $RESERVED_IP return`, `ip daddr 192.168.0.0/16 return`): Non-DNS traffic to router web interfaces, local NAS, and LAN services stays direct.
6. **Remaining TCP/UDP interception** (`ip protocol tcp/udp` -> TProxy / mark 1): Redirected to Xray dokodemo-door for Smart Routing.

| Traffic | Action / Rule | Reason |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Mark-2 packets | `meta mark $BYPASS_MARK return` | Xray outbounds |
| ICMP / essential ICMPv6 | `ip protocol icmp return` | Native ping & discovery |
| DNS from `xray` / `systemd-resolve` users (mark 0) | `meta skuid ... return` | Break the localhost/forward loop |
| Unmarked port-53 to `127.0.0.53` | `ip daddr 127.0.0.53 ... return` (prerouting) | Deliver Xray's `localhost` queries to the stub |
| DNS (port 53) | Intercepted to Xray | Clean DNS via DoH / Smart Split |
| Non-DNS Reserved & LAN (`10/8`, `192.168/16`, ...) | `return` | Local services direct |
| All other TCP/UDP | Intercepted to Xray | Transparent proxy |

Note: Higher-level application traffic (DNS port 53, HTTP port 80, Root processes) is intercepted by nftables and classified by Xray's routing engine (`geosite:cn`, `geosite:private`, captive portal probes, `geoip:cn`, etc.).

## Live Inspection

```sh
sudo nft list table ip xray_v4
sudo nft list table ip6 xray_v6
```

Every intercept rule carries a `counter` that increments per matched
packet.
